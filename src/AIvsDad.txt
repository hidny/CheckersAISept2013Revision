checkers AI vs Dad:

-implement the close button.

-Implement drag and drop

-Make it able to interpret dad's shaky hand.

-Resolve end games with some basic logic about how to end games. (no useless moves!)
CRITICAL: make the AI prioritize winning as soon as possible!

code:

Game game = new Game();
	  	Player p1 = new Human();
	  	Player p2 = new checkersAI.ComputerAIAlphaBetaPruneDrawAvoider(false, 12, new checkersUtility.UtilityAtEquilibriumPos(new checkersUtility.UtilityKingWantsCenter()), false); 
		   
	    
	    Player winner = game.playGame(p1, p2);
	    

	    if(winner instanceof Human) {
	    	System.out.println("Player 1 wins!");
	    } else if(winner == p2 ) {
	    	System.out.println("Player 2 wins!");
	    } else {
	    	System.out.println("Draw!");
	    }
